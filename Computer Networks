Some Important Terms

-> Network: A network refers to a collection of interconnected 	nodes or entities that are capable of communication and 	interaction with each other.

        ~LAN: Local Area Network
				 A LAN is a network that spans a small geographical area, 				 such as a home, office building, or campus. It enables 				 connected devices to share resources like printers, files, 				 and internet access.

        ~WAN: Wide Area Network
				 A WAN covers a larger geographical area, often 				 connecting multiple LANs together. The internet is the most 				 well-known example of a wide area network.

		~MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
				 A MAN covers a city or metropolitan area, providing 				 connectivity between various LANs.

		~Wireless Network:
				 This type of network allows devices to connect and 				 communicate wirelessly, without the need for physical 				 cables. Wi-Fi networks are a common example.

		~ Client-Server Network:
				 In this architecture, one or more central servers provide 				 services and resources to multiple client devices. Clients 				 request and utilize these resources over the network.
        ~ Peer-to-Peer Network (P2P): 
				 In a P2P network, devices connect directly with each other, 				 without relying on a central server. Each device can act as 				 both a client and a server, sharing resources and information 				 with other devices in the network.
->Internet: The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that spans the entire globe.

At its core, the internet is based on the TCP/IP protocol suite, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP defines the rules and procedures for data transmission and routing on the internet. This protocol suite ensures that data packets are properly addressed, routed, and delivered across the network.

The internet provides a wide range of services and resources, including:

(i) World Wide Web (WWW): The web is a system of interconnected hypertext documents and resources accessed through web browsers. It allows users to browse websites, access information, and interact with web applications.

(ii) Email: Electronic mail (email) enables users to send and receive messages electronically over the internet. It is one of the most widely used communication services on the internet.

(iii) File Transfer: The internet allows users to transfer files between computers using various protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or cloud storage services.

(iv) Instant Messaging and Voice/Video Calls: Internet-based messaging platforms and applications enable real-time text, voice, and video communication between individuals and groups.

(v) Social Media: Social networking platforms provide a space for users to create profiles, connect with others, share content, and communicate.
